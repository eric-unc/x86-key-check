# x86-key-check
A simple little program to check an x86/AMD64 CPU's support for both memory protection keys (MPK) and protection keys supervisor (PKS).

MPK is supported on newer Intel/AMD CPUs, but thus far PKS is only supported on newer Intel CPUs. No idea if future AMD CPUs (or newer than I have) will support PKS. But hey, that's where this little program can help.
